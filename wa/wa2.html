    <h3>My Goals</h3>
    <p>I want to be able to create a personal website for portfolio reasons without having to rely on a service such as Wix or SquareSpace, as I wouldn't have real ownership of that website</p>
    <p>As good as LinkedIn is for finding people and networking, it isn't the greatest for hosting material that might actually get you hired. And always having to link to a Google Drive isn't entirely practical either.</p>
